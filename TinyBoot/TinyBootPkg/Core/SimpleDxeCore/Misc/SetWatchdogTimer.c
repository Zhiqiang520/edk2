/**
  Sets the system's watchdog timer.

  @param  Timeout         The number of seconds to set the watchdog timer to.
                          A value of zero disables the timer.
  @param  WatchdogCode    The numeric code to log on a watchdog timer timeout
                          event. The firmware reserves codes 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.
                          Loaders and operating systems may use other timeout
                          codes.
  @param  DataSize        The size, in bytes, of WatchdogData.
  @param  WatchdogData    A data buffer that includes a Null-terminated Unicode
                          string, optionally followed by additional binary data.
                          The string is a description that the call may use to
                          further indicate the reason to be logged with a
                          watchdog event.

  @return EFI_SUCCESS               Timeout has been set
  @return EFI_NOT_AVAILABLE_YET     WatchdogTimer is not available yet
  @return EFI_UNSUPPORTED           System does not have a timer (currently not used)
  @return EFI_DEVICE_ERROR          Could not complete due to hardware error
